Sensors
=======

Most of these sensors are easy to connect to an MCU on their own, often
requiring one or more resistors or capacitors to adjust for the MCU power level
or analog input capabilities. For easier use and less soldering it is therefore
easier to use one of the many breakout boards available online. These will
package the sensor with all the required components (usually in SMD formats) and
leads out clearly labelled pins to solder it onto the MCU with a few short wires
or to stick it to a breadboard for testing.
