/**

 * @brief MonSens implementation for the Adafruit breakout board for the Bosch
 * BMP280 sensor.
 *
 * The Bosch BMP280 sensor offers barometric pressure and temperature sensing in
 * a single chip. Adafruit offers a breakout board to easily connect the BMP280
 * to an MCU: <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2651>
 *
 * There are other similar breakout boards that may be used with the Adafruit
 * libraries, as long as they offer either I2C or SPI interfaces. Using hardware
 * SPI is preferred, if your MCU supports it.
