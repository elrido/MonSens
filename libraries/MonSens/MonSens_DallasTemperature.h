 * @brief MonSens implementation of the Dallas 18B20 temperature sensor.
 *
 * The Dallas 18B20 temperature sensor allows multiple sensors to be connected
 * on a shared bus. These can be powered descretely on a separate wire or via
 * a "parasitic" mode over the serial pin, allowing 3 or 2 wire setups.
