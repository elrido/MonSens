 * @brief MonSens Sensor implementation for the Adafruit breakout board for the
 * Bosch BME280 sensor.
 *
 * The Bosch BME280 sensor offers humidity, barometric pressure and temperature
 * sensing in a single chip. Adafruit offers a breakout board to easily connect
 * the BME280 to an MCU: <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652>
 *
 * There are other similar breakout boards that may be used with the Adafruit
 * libraries, as long as they offer either I2C or SPI interfaces. Using hardware
 * SPI is preferred, if your MCU supports it.
