 * @brief MonSens implementation of a simple light-sensitive resistor as sensor.
 *
 * Photoresistors, resistors that change their condictivity based on the light
 * in the environment, offer a simple solution to detect daylight or if a room
 * is in use or not, if the lights got turned off or similar.
